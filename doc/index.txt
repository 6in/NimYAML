Overview
========

**NimYAML** is a pure YAML implementation for Nim. It is able to read from and
write to YAML character streams, and to serialize from and construct to native
Nim types. It exclusively supports
`YAML 1.2 <#http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`_. NimYAML exposes all
processing steps defined by the YAML specification to the user, so it is
possible to customize the processing pipeline. The following diagram gives an
overview of NimYAML's features based on the YAML processing pipeline. The items
and terminology YAML defines is shown in black, NimYAML's implementation is
shown in red.
